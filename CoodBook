The final data set contains the following fields:
Activity - Indicating one of the following six activites: Walking, Walking_Upstairs, Walking_Downstairs, Sitting, Standing and
Laying
Subject - A numerical code identifying one of the 30 subjects
86 variables for each of which mean values are stored for each subject and activite combition.  These variables capture the mean
and standard deviation of the following factors:
- Point in time values for body acceleration, gravity acceleration, body acceleration jerk, body gyro and body gyro jerk 
  along X, Y and Z axes
- Point in time magnitudes for body acceleration, gravity acceleration, body gyro and body gyro jerk
- Fast Fourier Transformation values for body acceleration, body acceleration jerk and body gyro along X, Y and Z axes
- Fast Fourier Transformation magnitude for body acceleration, body acceleration jerk, body gyro and body gyro jerk
Additionally, there are variable for the angle of the following vectors: gravity, body acceleration, body acceleration jerk,
body gyro and body gyro jerk
